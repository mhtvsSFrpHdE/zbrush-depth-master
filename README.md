Mask a area, then use a simple approach to change its depth!

**What's this**  
In some case, the sculpted details may too thin or heavy.  
A approch is to use relax, morph target and layer to cover the details,  
then able to adjust the depth by layer intensity.  
The script is a programming version for fast.  

**How to use**  
Mask the details, invert the mask,  
run the scripts, then going to layer,  
duplicate the latest layer or adjust the intensity.  

**Known issue**  
It requires you to clear your current morph target,  
bakes all exist layer,  
clear any existing mask to only mask the detail area.
